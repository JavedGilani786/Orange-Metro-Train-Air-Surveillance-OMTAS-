# Orange-Metro-Train-Air-Surveillance-OMTAS-
“Orange Metro Air Surveillance and Object Detection with support of Delay Tolerant Network” purpose is to identify any object on the rail track of Orange Train by taking pictures of the track and sending it to its node station. There are a total of 27 stations. The distance of one station to the other station is almost 3 km so if the Drone/Quad copter flies almost 1.5 km from its station it needs to transmit the data to its station. But the range of wireless is 500 m. So with the help of Delay Tolerant Networks we will transmit the data that the Drone/Quad-copter has taken after the 500 m. Data will be transmitted as soon as the Drone/Quad-Copter gets back into network range.
